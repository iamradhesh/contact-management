# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Sure! Hereâ€™s a sample documentation for your Vite project using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and React Router DOM:

# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a web application developed using Vite, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and React Router DOM. The setup provides a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and incorporates modern front-end technologies for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **[Material UI](https://mui.com/)**: A popular React UI framework with a rich set of components.
- **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)**: Declarative routing for React.js applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

To start the development server and see your application in action, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided in the terminal) to view the application.

## Project Structure

- **`src/components/`**: Contains React components used throughout the application.
- **`src/pages/`**: Contains page components corresponding to different routes.
- **`src/styles/`**: Contains Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styles.
- **`src/App.tsx`**: The main application component where routes and layout are defined.
- **`src/main.tsx`**: The entry point for the React application.
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite configuration file.

## Development

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite provides HMR out of the box. Changes to your files will be reflected instantly without a full page reload.
- **Linting**: ESLint rules are set up to maintain code quality. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues.

## Deployment

For deploying your application, build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be located in the `dist` directory, which you can then deploy to your preferred hosting service.
